In a way, probably not clearly articulated in the history, they were trying to establish a satellite town where institutions could be raised.

The All India Radio came up making Mysore an important broadcasting station, nearly 100 years ago. Ideal Jawa Ltd., India's most prestigious motorcycle manufacturing unit of that time was located in Yadavagiri by mid 20th century, making Mysore an industrial hub. When the Government moved to Bangalore, a number of aristocratic families and important personalities were given housing in Yadavagiri, making it a landmark destination of the city.
