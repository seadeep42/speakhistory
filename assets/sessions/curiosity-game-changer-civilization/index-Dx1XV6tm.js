The ability to select and develop crops, fruit, and domesticated animals were founded on curiosity about the diversity seen in Nature, and then a realization this could be exploited by focused management.

An interesting question to ask is whether curiosity is unique to humans? Curiosity leads to intuitive and inquisitive mindset, then it requires imagination and creativity to find the answers. On these lines the level of “curiosity” seen in humans is unique! Other animals do show information seeking abilities but they are for the needs of survival.

This defines the interests that we develop in learning, exploration and questioning the unknowns of this world. It is beautiful to look into history and see how the development of arts, language, settlements, technology evolved and unfolded leading to the present day. Now as a species we have moved much beyond meeting our daily needs to more exciting explorations of this world and beyond.

The few centuries of medieval ages were “dark” with respect to 'curiosity'. Questioning and inquiry were treated as sin and punished. We hear the stories of people like Socrates and Galileo who were punished for challenging the prevalent beliefs. Later, with more awareness in the society, 'curiosity' started being treated as a much-needed trait leading to scientific revolution and today 'curiosity' is very much talked about as a virtue. From education to employability, 'curiosity' is a much sought after trait. The nature has nurtured and safeguarded this trait during evolution and has let us continue to do so. The 'molecule of more', that is dopamine, is a chemical that is released in our brains as a reward when we seek and find answers to the unknown. This molecule allows us to experience and feel joy.
