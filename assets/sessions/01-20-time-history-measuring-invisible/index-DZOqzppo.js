It is a fundamental reference in our lives, without pegging to which, no story or no progress can ever be perceived. Without even knowing what it is, even the earliest humans felt it in the passing of the day and night. But the clever Egyptians and Babylonians began organizing calendars some 5,000 years ago. Then, the eras, epochs, hours, seconds, years and millennia were measured, quantified and the pages of history were hung by the strings of time. And in the process, we learnt to link the sun, the moon, the earth, the universe and everything fundamentally physical in measuring the most practical imagination we ever had - the time.",prev:t["01-19-transatlantic"],next:t["02-01-etruscan"]},e.createElement("p",null,"Ever since humans developed awareness about their surroundings, they have been seeing sunrises, sunsets, seasons, new moon, full moon, stars, constellations and their movements across the sky. The question is since when did they begin to 'feel' the passage of time and how a primitive concept of time evolved into a complex perception that underlines almost every activity that we undertake now!",e.createElement("br",null),e.createElement("br",null),"If one looks at history, it is quite evident that there are two ways to asses time. ONE - by looking at the regularly recurring natural events in the environment and TWO - by artificially dividing it to suit our everchanging lifestyle. Ancient Sumerians set the ball rolling by dividing time on a ‘Base 60’ method, which was adopted by Babylonians through times of wars and famines, during which the inter-civilizational interactions increased due to either aggression or migration. By the time the Roman Empire was established, the concept of calendar was well formed but it further metamorphosized into Julian and later Gregorian calendars for what appears to be the sole purpose of fixing a date for Easter. However, that exercise of juggling between the calendars required addition or deletion of months and days at the whims and fancies of the ruling and the priestly classes. Introduction of Julian and Gregorian calendars had a separation of over a 1000 years and as could be expected, editing some days in the calendar became necessary as all measurements, however intricate they were structured, had to finally depend on the fixed physical relationship between the stellar bodies, particularly the sun and the earth.",e.createElement("br",null),e.createElement("br",null),"Alexander the Great's conquests also helped spread these western ideas of timekeeping to the Greeks and Indians. This was aided by various luminaries postulating then that the earth was flat and could be marked with coordinates. The coordinates were drawn on the map through geometrical precision, which were divided initially into degrees by Hipparchus, whose successors like Ptolemy then divided the degree into minutes and seconds. Persian scholars like Al Baruni also divided the coordinates into minutes, seconds, thirds and fourths while other Persian scholars like Al Khwarizmi were busy inventing Algebra based upon the inventions of Brahmagupta and others, who by then had established zero and the Indian numerical system of 0 to 9. This knowledge went back and forth for a long time between East and west. But in the process, timekeeping was becoming refined and essential in understanding nature.",e.createElement("br",null),e.createElement("br",null),"By the time the renaissance began, the system of timekeeping and calendars had come of age and most ambiguities were getting gradually ironed out. In the 16th century, Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe prudently used degrees minutes and seconds and developed a large array of celestial data. This helped Kepler to come up with the laws of planetary motions, which in turn helped Newton to propound the laws of gravity, thereby laying foundation to modern physics and precision knowledge of the nature of the universe. These findings further helped the development of mechanical clocks which begat spring clocks that delivered higher accuracy to the measurement of time. Pendulums made further difference to the measurement of time as they relied more on physical principles unlike the arbitrary sand clocks which had a long run in civilization. The pocket watches and wrist watches that came later were followed by automatic, quartz and atomic clocks improving the accuracy of time measurement to fractions of a second, resulting in an insignificant error of 1 second per 300 billion years!",e.createElement("br",null),e.createElement("br",null),"Thus, the measurement of time has also been an aspect of development in human civilizations. It has gone through a long process of trial and error. From being just a recognition of day and night in the early part of civilization, atomic clocks of high accuracy have enabled space exploration and precision computing. In the background, an argument has always remained whether time is a physical entity or a grand illusion of the mind. Regardless of that debate about time per se, the measurement of time is a highly evolved entity, without which a systematic progress in civilization would not have been possible.")),s=n(document.getElementById("root"));s.render(e.createElement(i,null));
