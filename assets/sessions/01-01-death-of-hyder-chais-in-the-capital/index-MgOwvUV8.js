Although he was in pain for weeks or months, the death was not expected. His son, Tipu Sultan was out on campaign in faraway Malabar and due to the unexpected death of Hyder and a lack of any clear plan of transfer of powers, the kingdom suddenly turned vulnerable to external aggressions and internal conspiracies. The real threat was from the neighbouring kingdoms, while the British were frustrated that Mysore was their last un-surrendered hold out in India. Internally, the erstwhile ruling dynasty of Mysore too had felt placated and were waiting for an opportunity to regain the throne. There were factions within Hyder Ali's wider family and administration that wanted Tipu Sultan's younger brother Karim to ascend to power, so that they could rule by proxy. Karim was not considered as the correct choice to power by Hyder Ali himself, but there are mentions in the archives that Hyder Ali's wife had sworn during her days of difficulty in bearing a child that she will dedicate her first son to the service of God, which Hyder Ali did not honour as he found Tipu the king material.",e.createElement("br",null),e.createElement("br",null),"Thus, odds were against Tipu Sultan and his ascent to throne was fraught with deep difficulties.

",e.createElement("br",null),e.createElement("br",null),"As a result, the news of the death of Hyder Ali was kept a secret until the time Tipu Sultan rushed back from his Malabar campaign. The casket bearing the body of Hyder Ali was secretly moved to Srirangapatna - the capital, in guise of treasure recovered in the war. The British at first did not believe that Hyder was dead when they heard the news and General Stuart in command of the army could not mobilise forces to attack Mysore immediately. Tipu Sultan swiftly neutralised a conspiracy to coronate his younger brother, by arresting and killing the military men responsible for the idea. He kept at bay the brewing conspiracy of the erstwhile rulers of Mysore by restricting them severely. And he placated the young commander of Bednur in the borderlands with Marathas, so that his conspiratorial plans of teaming up with the British and other adversaries could not be realised.",e.createElement("br",null),e.createElement("br",null),"The short period of time between the death of his father and his consolidation of power between 1782 and 1783 was a dramatic one, filled with conspiracies, treacheries, greed, power politics, a kingdom's vulnerability and a deep fear of the unknown. The young Sultan, with the help of loyal officers of the court, displayed immense courage and composure in ascending to the throne, which he successfully held for the next 16 years."),e.createElement(i,{photos:n})),s=a(document.getElementById("root"));s.render(e.createElement(o,null));
