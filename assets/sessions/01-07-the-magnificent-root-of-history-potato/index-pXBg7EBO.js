With their high nutrition value, potatoes sustained the Incan civilization.  During the 16th century, Conquistador Francisco Pizarro brought the first samples of potatoes from Peru to Europe.

During the 18th and early 19th centuries, potatoes had become the prime Irish staple food.  Around the same time, potatoes also began emerging in mainland Europe as a cheap substitution to other staple foods like bread.  Notable in efforts of popularising potatoes was Frederick the 2nd of Prussia, who promoted their farming and usage in a big way in his country and his military campaigns were greatly supported by potato stocks as the prime food source for soldiers.  Incidentally, Antoine Parmentier, a French agronomist and Pharmacist was on military service and had been arrested in a war with Prussia. He was served with potatoes in his prison cell and he liked them so immensely that upon his release, he campaigned for the consumption of potatoes in France, including with the Royal court.
