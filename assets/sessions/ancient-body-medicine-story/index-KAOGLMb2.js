The Rigveda, one of the oldest sacred texts, contains references to various herbs and plants of medicinal properties, highlighting an early awareness of the therapeutic potential of nature. Ayurveda began to take shape in around 600 BCE.  Charaka Samhita, attributed to Sage Charaka provided a wholesome guide to diagnosis, treatment, dietary regulations and lifestyle modifications relating to diseases.

In Ayurveda, Charaka Samhita for medicine and Sushruta Samhita for surgery have laid out elaborate details.  The legend has it that both samhitas are 'apourusheya', meaning that they are of divine origin.  But the recorded history places both of them at around 2nd to 3rd Century BCE.

Pathology, anatomy, sensory organs, therapeutics, pharmaceutics are all embedded in these.  Much later to the original text, another 17 chapters were added, making it wholesome.  Meanwhile,  Sushruta Samhita is made of 6 chapters and 8 disciplines and is as wholesome in conceptual treatment as the modern surgery.  A 9th century manuscript found in Taklamakan and a 17th century manuscript found from Tanjaur, have enhanced our understanding of these and have also revelealed how several contributors successively embellished the central texts.",e.createElement("br",null),e.createElement("br",null),"In contrast, the Siddha medicine is perhaps much older to Ayurveda in origin.
