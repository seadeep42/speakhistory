They were established in the Bronze age and were strategically situated in the midst of several other great civilizations like Greek, Egyptian, Babylonian, Mesopotamian and Phoenician, spanning across productive lands between the rivers - Nile and Tigris, called the 'fertile crescent'.  Mythological sources like the Old Testament mention about the Israelite ownership to the land of Canaan while Archaeological texts trace Late Bronze Age migrations of people from the rim and islands of Eastern Mediterranean and Levant into the region.  Since the ancient times, especially since the Late Bronze Age, there has been ample mixing of people, cultures, trade and beliefs in the region.  However, in the past 3,000 years, three major religions, namely Judaism, Christianity and Islam took birth one after the other in this region and demarcated distinct and separating identity to the inhabitants of Canaan, while they all continued to share and revere the land's heritage assets.  Jews, Greeks, Romans, Persians, Babylonians, Assyrians, Muslims and finally British held the region for different periods of time. However, the differences grew exponentially between the Muslim Palestinians and Jewish Israelites, both of whom trace their origin and ownership to the land and devotedly guard their access to the shared heritage assets.   A British plan to divide the land into two nations â€“ Israel and Palestine, polarized the issue further in the end of the First World War.  Then rising from the worldwide sympathy for the Jewish cause after the genocide of millions during the Second World War, the nation of Israel declared independence in 1948.  This became a turning point in the conflict between Islamic/Arab nations and Israel and several wars ensued in regular interval between them.
