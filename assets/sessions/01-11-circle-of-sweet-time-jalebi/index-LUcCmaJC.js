This suggests a Middle Eastern origin, possibly Persia (present-day Iran). The author describes the making of a crispy, juicy, crunchy, hollow and lattice-shaped dessert in sugar syrup called Zalabiyeh. Recipe according to the Al-Warraq is to mix all-purpose flour (maida), gram flour (from brown chickpea) saffron, cardamom, rose water, and yeast and Buraq-al-Ajin, i.e., borax (banned today by the govt of the world). Borax acts as a preservative and improves elasticity and crispiness of the jalebis. For the syrup the book says use sugar, honey, saffron, cardamom and lemon (adds clarity to the syrup), musk or camphor may be added to enhance taste. A coconut shell with a small hole was used then for streaming the flour into hot fat called Aliya, extracted from Awassi sheep. So, by 10th century, it looks quite well evolved and refined already.
