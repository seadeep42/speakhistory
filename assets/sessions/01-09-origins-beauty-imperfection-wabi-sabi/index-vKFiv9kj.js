It stands in direct opposition to the West's worldview founded on Plato's philosophy that holds the world to a fixed 'perfect' ideal. Wabi-sabi's foundational principles are inextricably linked to Buddhism that Japan readily embraced, 6th century CE onwards, especially Buddha's beliefs about the reality of life: Impermanence (anitta), Suffering (dhukka) and Non-Self (anicca).",e.createElement("br",null),e.createElement("br",null),"Chasing the history of wabi-sabi means chasing the history of Japan. And China. And Korea. While most wabi-sabi literature point to Zen Buddhism and the tea ceremony as key influences, both came to Japan from China, via Korea. Why then, did wabi-sabi arise uniquely in Japan? Also, why did it come to be infused with so much 'feeling'? Over a span of four centuries and two dynasties (Asuka and Nara, 592 CE - 794 CE) Japan imported Chinese culture en masse - three religious philosophies (Taoism, Confucianism, Buddhism), government and bureaucracy, script and calligraphy, painting and sculpture, tea and its drinking ceremony. After which, conflict in China meant the end of formal courtly relations for a period. But all the building blocks of wabi-sabi were in place. Having swallowed the whole meal of Chinese culture, Japan isolated itself during the Heain period (700-1185 CE), which helped blossom Japanese culture's golden age. Driven by the powerful aristocratic clans (that ruled, while the figurehead emperor reigned), Japan achieved a level of refinement and nuance that may be best summed up by a feeling - mono no aware, the 'pathos or melancholy of things' owing to their transience. This melancholy infused not just the period's culture - from the world's first novel, Lady Murasaki Shikibu's Tale of Genji, to waka poetry and yamato-e painting - but also Japan's aesthetic sensibility ever since.",e.createElement("br",null),e.createElement("br",null),"In the centuries that followed, powerful cultural forces like Samurai and Bushido, Confucianism and restraint, Zen Buddhism and simplicity, Taoism and 'flow', the rise of wealth and ostentation, and the Wabicha tea ceremonies came together in the crucible of a society in upheaval, giving rise to the wabi-sabi 'rustic simplicity' aesthetic and sensibility that percolated deep into the nature-loving Japanese psyche. Wabi-sabi's highpoint was also its low-point. Lord Toyotomi Hideyoshi, the second great unifier of Japan, saw his Grand Tea Master Rikyu's wabi-sabi experiments as undermining his authority, and a joke on his peasant roots. In a sadly befitting end that's the ultimate testament to transience, Sen no Rikyū was ordered to commit sepukku, which he did after having a final tea party with friends, and writing a jisei (death poem). ",e.createElement("br",null),e.createElement("br",null),"Sen no Rikyū left behind a stunningly sophisticated legacy that represented the distillation of many millennia of human self-cultivation and mindfulness; as well as a return to nature, even as society was getting increasingly alienated from it; a worldview that brings welcome relief from the pursuit of perfection that the world is belabouring after, by simply accepting that nature is beautiful, never perfect, or perhaps, beautiful because it is imperfect."),e.createElement(n,{photos:s})),r=a(document.getElementById("root"));r.render(e.createElement(o,null));
