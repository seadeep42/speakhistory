Then, the earth went through several geo-bio-physical time periods which we popularly call as Eons that are further subdivided into Eras, Periods and Epochs. These time periods have alternated between several ice ages and warm periods, each time the clay playing a major planetary role.",e.createElement("br",null),e.createElement("br",null),'The Holocene Epoch that began 11,700 years ago is widely regarded as the present one in this sequence of earth time. Around the beginning of Holocene, the negative impact of a rapid cooling phase of an event called the ‘;Younger Dryas’ or the " Big Freeze" had a negative impact on the flora and the fauna, which consequentially forced the hunting-gathering Paleolithic man to usher into Neolithic era and begin agriculture. This milestone in the civilization was an adaptation to the forcings of nature. These climactic changes and demographic pressures also contributed to the necessity of inventing agriculture for man, who by then was already passing through a semi sedentary phase. The 23,000 year old Natufian culture at Ohalo II on the banks of the sea of Galilee demonstrates this fact. Also, the incipient Agriculturists seem to have overcome the initial challenges of farming and domestication of animals in the golden crescent region, a part that covers Jordan, Israel, Lebanon, Cyprus, Syria, ancient Anatolia and a small part of Egypt. Once the early Holocene man became comfortable after having solved the sustenance problem in the first 3 pre-pottery neolithic age, he began turning his attention towards higher goals. He started building dwellings, making pottery, ornaments, toys and musical instruments among other things. With each culture named after the pottery found during archeological excavations, beginning from the neolithic to the chalcolithic age through the bronze age and upto the iron age, the art of pottery, construction of settlements, villages, towns and city-states got better and better using the applications of clay. Each region in the world had its own pottery culture. maturing through the ages of civilization.',e.createElement("br",null),e.createElement("br",null),"In India, in the Harppan and the vedic age, clay as construction material had its run through stages of maturity where clay bricks were used to build the large Harappan cities of Mohenjo Daro, Rakhigarhi, Kalibangan etc. Pottery was used for storing grains & liquids, for cooking and for funerary rituals. Later stages saw the use of pottey only for storage, cooking and ornamentation. Today, clay still holds its place as an eco-friendly construction material like that used in rammed earth construction, adobe bricks etc."),e.createElement(n,{photos:s})),r=a(document.getElementById("root"));r.render(e.createElement(o,null));
