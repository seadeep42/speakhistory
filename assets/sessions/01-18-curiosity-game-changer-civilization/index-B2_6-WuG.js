This defines the interests that we develop in learning, exploration and questioning the unknowns of this world.

The few centuries of medieval ages were “dark” with respect to 'curiosity'. Questioning and inquiry were treated as sin and punished. We hear the stories of people like Socrates and Galileo who were punished for challenging the prevalent beliefs. Later, with more awareness in the society, 'curiosity' started being treated as a much-needed trait leading to scientific revolution and today 'curiosity' is very much talked about as a virtue. From education to employability, 'curiosity' is a much sought after trait. The nature has nurtured and safeguarded this trait during evolution and has let us continue to do so. The 'molecule of more', that is dopamine, is a chemical that is released in our brains as a reward when we seek and find answers to the unknown. This molecule allows us to experience and feel joy.
