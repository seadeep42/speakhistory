A good water management system was behind their success, which is evidenced by the presence of diversion channels , canals, wells and storage structures. One reality of the Indian subcontinent has been the fact that a whole year's supply of the water through rains is delivered in about 100 rainy days of monsoon. Managing this seasonal bounty over the remaining days of the year has been a challenge of survival. Opportunities for harvesting this rain water running off in seasonal streams by putting bunds across them for drinking, agriculture and other uses require great ingenuity. This challenge resulted in the dispersed nature of numerous villages across India. Then,  success in agriculture saw claims over lands and territories, leading to the rise of kingdoms and dynasties. Eventually,  the rulers built more lakes, assuring food security and prosperity for the people and the region. Thus, immense socio cultural values got associated with water and people worshipped water. Building spiritual and religious spaces around them, people revered water and and conserved it.  Endowments of lands (Bittuvatta) were made for the maintenance of the lakes and social systems of 'Nirgantis' to manage the upkeep of canals  and distribution of water. The period between 600 AD and 1700 AD saw establishment of most of the lakes we see today.

Later, another 25 km long canal by the same name was laid around the Yelwal ridge to bring water to Kukkarahalli kere in the city.
