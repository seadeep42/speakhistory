Then the kingdoms of Castille and Aragon in peninsular Spain (Iberia) felt the pressing need to come together to force out the Islamic footprint from Europe that existed in Granada.

His return to Spain with proof of finding land across the Atlantic not only gave him an enviable stature, but started a flurry of expeditions across the ocean in search of treasure. Within a century, the Spanish conquest had given rise to Western European expeditions to the entire continental stretch of Americas, resulting in a huge exchange of fauna and flora across the Atlantic, and inter-mixing of the hitherto separated human races.
