Mysore art is an amalgamation of styles from various regions and religions. The earliest sculptures around Mysore from the 10th century, the Gomateswara Bahubali statues, were carved during the time of Ganga dynasty. Some other Bahubali statues were made in the later centuries suggesting the flourishing of Jain religion, especially the Digambara Jain sect, in and around Mysore and Belur. A crucial transition occurred during the Hoysala period (1006 to 1346 CE) when the king, Vishnuvardhana, converted to Hinduism while the queen, Shantala, continued rooting her belief system in Jainism.

The usage of natural colours and mineral colours in the later periods, and thin gold leaf suggest the inspirations.
