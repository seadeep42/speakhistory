Known as Iran from the 20th century, deriving from the word 'Airyanam' from the ancient Avestan language, which meant 'Aryan', Persia is perhaps the largest kingdom ever built in human history.  As such, every empire builder in the world, always desired to occupy, subjugate and possess Persia.  This also resulted in Persia becoming one of the most invaded civilizations in history, the big ones being Greeks from the West, Mongols from the North and Islamic rulers from South.   In spite of these frequent run-overs and destructions, the Persian civilization cast an immense influence on most of the world including India.    ",e.createElement("br",null),e.createElement("br",null),"The earliest known civilization in Persia dates back to the Elamite kingdom around 2700 BCE. The Achaemenid Empire, founded by Cyrus the Great in the 6th century BCE, became the first recognizable Persian Empire, coinciding with the decline of Egyptian civilization . It was known for its vast territorial expansion, including the conquest of Babylon by Cyrus and the construction of Persepolis.  Subsequently, Darius the Great further expanded the Achaemenid Empire and introduced the famous Royal Road, connecting the empire's distant regions.  This spurred enormous growth.  The empire was eventually defeated by Alexander the Great in the 4th century BCE, leading to Hellenistic rule in Persia.  Then between 247 BCE and 651 BCE, the Parthian and Sassanian empires ruled Persia, until the Islamic rulers conquered Persia in the 7th century BCE.  Despite the Arab conquest, Persian culture and language continued to flourish and exerted a significant influence on Islamic civilization.  In the 13th century, the Mongol Empire, led by Genghis Khan and later his grandson Hulagu Khan, invaded Persia, causing widespread destruction.  By early 16th century, the Safavids established a Shiite Muslim dynasty and played a crucial role in shaping modern Iran.  Isfahan became a center of Persian culture and art during this period.  Later, the Qajar dynasty ruled Persia in the 18th and 19th centuries and faced various challenges, including European imperialist interests and social upheaval.  Subsequently, Reza Shah Pahlavi founded the Pahlavi dynasty in 1925, marking the end of the Qajar era.  Reza Shah Pahlavi modernized Iran but ruled as an authoritarian monarch.  His son, Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi, continued modernization efforts but faced growing opposition due to his extravagant and western ways of life, leading to the Iranian Revolution in 1979.  The revolution resulted in the establishment of an Islamic Republic, with Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini as its leader.  Iran has since experienced political and social changes, including conflicts with neighbours, sanctions from the west, and efforts to balance Islamic values with modernization.
